# Generate-Gen
A lightweight Go module to demonstrate how to generate autogen in go from proto using protoc.

# Guidelines
- go.mod:- Use a fully qualified path if hosting the module publicly. (e.g., github.com/username/repo-name)
- I will store all protocol buffer files in the proto/api directory.
- I will create user directory under proto/api which have user service related proto.
- Place all dependencies alongside api directory.
